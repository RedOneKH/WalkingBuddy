# WalkingBuddy
Hackatown 2017 submission

# Inspiration
Universities in rural areas all face a similar problem: darker and less populated streets. Walking Buddy was created as a service to help people match up and walk together instead of walking alone.

# What it does
Users simply enter their destination and Walking Buddy will match them with someone going in the same direction. Users will never see the other person's exact destination and offers a Facebook authentication to verify the same person you're matched with is the same person that walks with you on your way home. Walking Buddy works a safety tool as well as a social media platform. You will be paired with someone who is Friends of Friends of the User using Facebook's friend list so you can build your own friends list.

# What's next for Walking Buddy
Several features can be added to Walking Buddy in the future. These include a rating system, the use of city data to avoid high crime areas on your way home, and internal messaging on the app.
